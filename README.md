DataFrame, where the dataset contains data of different mails and is classified into spam and not spam, the following are the tasks that are to be taken into consideration while constructing LSTM model, to predict binary classification

conclusion:As we can see that we have built a good model which is able to predict very accuracte with more than 85%
